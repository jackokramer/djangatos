                        <a href="http://www.stringphonic.com/" class="gear-link">Stringphonic Guitars</a> - Witmeyer's current number one is a Dell'Arte prototype made by Harry Takamoto at Stringphonic
                        guitars in Japan. The guitar was sold to Robert by gypsy jazz impresario Alain Cola, who is credited with bringing gypsy
                        jazz acoustics to the American masses. Alain was kind enough to sell Robert one of his prototypes, igniting a musical
                        romance for the ages. The petite bouche model features a solid bear-claw spruce top, mahogany neck, and laminate
                        Brazilian Rosewood back and sides (more than likely actually Pau Ferro wood). The guitar had a K&K Pure Maccaferri
                        pickup added later, and was refetted by Keith Holland.

                    petite bouche model. The guitar was the first legit gypsy acoustic guitar Samson owned, and was given to him by his dad
                    and original owner, Gypsy Jazz legend Dorado Schmitt. The guitar needs serious work, but Witmeyer looks forward to
                    performing the song "Bossa Dorado" and the guitar owned by the song's composer when it is fully restored.</p>
                    <p class="grid-text"><a href="" class="gear-link">Vega Banjo</a>  - Robert inherited a 100 year old Vega plectrum banjo which he incorporates into the set favorites like Fat's
                    Waller's "Ain't Misbehavin" and the Orginal Dixieland Jazz band's hit "Tiger Rag."</p>
                    <p class="grid-text"><a href="https://www.emlpicks.com/" class="gear-link">EML Plectrums</a> - EML picks were handmade in California by Eric Lopez using Casein, a synthetic tortoiseshell material
                    made from milk and vinegar. Friends with Robert for many years now, Eric created a handmade signature pick for Witmeyer,
                    which he uses primarily with his Stringphonic petite bouche. Other gauge and shape EML picks are paired with Witmeyer's
                    other instruments, as he loves the tone and feel of Eric's creations.

                        - while this style of music is primarily acoustic, inevitably the band has to amp up for some
                        of the larger shows. Their main goal is to have the acoustic electric amp sound as true to the timbre of the
                        acoustic
                        instrument as possible. The group finds the Recording King songwriter 60 to be the perfect amp for such a demand.
                        It's
                        clean, light, looks good, and most importantly, does a stellar job retaining the unique tone of a gypsy acoustic.
                        Ron also play's through a VHT Amp.
